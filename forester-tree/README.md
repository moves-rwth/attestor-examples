Forester benchmarks: Singly-linked lists
========================================

A collection of Java implementations of programs working with singly-linked lists
 (originally written in C) that are taken from the [Forester tool](https://github.com/kdudka/predator/tree/master/tests/forester).


You can run all examples once using a prepared shell script as follows:

    $ ./run.sh

Alternatively, exexute the following maven statement within this directory:

    $ mvn clean install exec:exec@run.



The full benchmark suite runs each example multiple times. It can be started using the following script:

    $ ./benchmarks.sh

Alternatively, you can use the following maven statement:

    $ mvn clean install exec:exec@benchmark
